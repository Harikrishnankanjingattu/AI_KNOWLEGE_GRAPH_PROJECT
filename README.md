## 📌 Project Description
This project is an **AI-Based Graph Builder** designed to analyze enterprise data and convert it into an intelligent, connected knowledge system. The platform uses **artificial intelligence, knowledge graphs, and semantic search** to understand relationships between data entities and present meaningful insights through an interactive dashboard.

The system helps transform raw enterprise data into structured knowledge that can be explored visually and queried using natural language.

## ⚙️ How the System Works
The project follows a unified AI-driven process:
- Enterprise data is collected from multiple sources
- Data is cleaned, standardized, and converted into a common format
- Important entities and relationships are identified
- A dynamic knowledge graph is generated
- Semantic embeddings enable intelligent search
- AI retrieves relevant context and generates accurate insights
- Results are visualized through an interactive dashboard with trust and confidence indicators
